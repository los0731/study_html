The Google search page is made of 3 parts: `navigation / content / footer`. The navigation is further split into left menu area and right button area. In the right button area there are various Google app-shaped icon buttons, Google login button etc. In the content area the Google logo image, search bar, as well as Google Search button and `I'm feeling lucky` button are placed in determined order. Last but not least, in the footer, similar to the navigation bar, links are each placed on the left and right. 

And so we will set up the page structure in the following order: navigation / content / footer. In brief, it goes as follows: 

```
|- Navigation
    |- Left area
    |   |- About    
    |   |- Store
    |- Right area
    |   |- Gmail
    |   |- Images
    |   |- Google apps button
    |   |- Sign in button

    |- Google logo image
