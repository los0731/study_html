### Container

우리는 컨테이너를 생성하는 것으로 시작할 수 있습니다. 컨테이너는 무언가를 담아두고 있는 의미를 가지고 있습니다. 여기서는 이미지와 글들을 담아두겠죠. 이런 컨테이너 역할을 하는 태그는 여러 가지가 있지만, 지금과 같이 특정한 의미가 없는 묶음일 경우 주로 `<div> `를 사용합니다.


**Instructions**
1. Add `<div>` within `<body>` and apply `class="container"`
    ```html
    <div class="container"></div>
    ```



### Components of Container

From now on, add the remaining elements in `<div class="container">`. Add image, title, post date, subheadings, and main text from above in order.


**Instructions**
1. Add `<img>` within `<div class="container">` and apply `src="img_google_play.png"` and `alt="Google Play"`.
    ```html
    <img src="img_google_play.png" alt="Google Play">
    ```

1. Add `<h1>`(title) to the next line of `<img>`, fill in the content below.

    ```html
    <h1>Google Play Terms of Service</h1>
    ```

1. Add `<h6>` to the next line of `<h1>`, fill in the content below.
    ```html
    <h6>February 5, 2018</h6>
    ```

1. Add `<h2>`(subheading) to the next line of `<h6>`, fill in the content below.

    ```html
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    ```

1. Add `<p>`(main text) to the next line of `<h2>`, fill in the content below.
    ```html
    <p>
