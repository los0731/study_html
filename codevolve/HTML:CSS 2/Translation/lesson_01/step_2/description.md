# HTML
### .container

We can start off by creating the container. A `container` here means that it contains something within. In this case, it will have an image and text. There are many kinds of tags that act as this kind of container, but we use `<div>` for bundles, like we have now, that don`t carry any specific meaning. 


**Instructions**
1. Add `<div>` within `<body>` and apply `class="container"`
    ```html
    <div class="container"></div>
    ```



### Components of Container

From now on, add the remaining elements in `<div class="container">`. Add image, headline, posting, subheadline, and body text from above in order.


**Instructions**
1. Add `<img>` within `<div class="container">` and apply `src="img_google_play.png"` and `alt="Google Play"`.
    ```html
    <img src="img_google_play.png" alt="Google Play">
    ```

1. Add `<h1>`(headline) to the next line of `<img>`, fill in the content below.

    ```html
    <h1>Google Play Terms of Service</h1>
    ```

1. Add `<h6>`(posting) to the next line of `<h1>`, fill in the content below.
    ```html
    <h6>February 5, 2018</h6>
    ```

1. Add `<h2>`(subheadline) to the next line of `<h6>`, fill in the content below.

    ```html
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    ```

1. Add `<p>`(body text) to the next line of `<h2>`, fill in the content below.
    ```html
    <p>

1. In the next line, add the second `<h2>`(subheadline) and `<p>`(body text) in the same way as above.

    ```html

Are you done? Since we only wrote the `HTML`, without any `CSS`, the page looks awkward, but that's alright! it's considered a good practice to first just use `HTML` to write the framework. Now let's do some styling, with `CSS`.
