As much as writing the code itself, it is important to understand it's structure. On this page the logo image and text are listed in a specific order in one bundle aka. a `container`. We first have to use HTML to set up the framework for this page. 

```
|- Body
    |- Container
    |   |- Logo Image
    |   |- Headline
    |   |- Posting
    |   |- Subheadline 1
    |   |- Body text
    |   |- Subheadline 2
    |   |- Body text
    |   |- Subheadline 3
    |   |- Body text
    |   |- ...
```
