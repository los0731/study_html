# Medium Legal

Do you remember the Google policy page we made in lesson 1? This time let's try and make a better designed and more visually appealing one, that is [Medium's policy page][https://legal.medium.com/].



### Structure on this page

This page is divided into 3 areas: navigation area/ hero [image] area / container area. The container area consists of a title, subheadings and body text. 

```
|- Body
    |- Navigation bar
    |- Hero image
    |- Container
    |   |- Content
    |   |   |- Headline-group
    |   |   |   |- Headline
    |   |   |   |- Sub-headline
    |   |   |- Body text
    |   |- Content
    |   |   |- Headline-group
    |   |   |   |- Headline
    |   |   |   |- Sub-headline
    |   |   |- Body text
    |   |- ...
```



### Default Font

Medium uses it's own fonts. In this lesson, we cannot use the exact same fonts as Medium, however a CSS code has been attached here, so we can use something similar. We brought in the fonts from [Google Fonts][https://fonts.google.com/].
