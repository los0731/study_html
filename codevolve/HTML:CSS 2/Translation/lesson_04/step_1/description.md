# Payment Receipt

Which code editor do you use? Are you, by any chance, using one of the following?  

* Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* ATOM (https://atom.io/)

Even though those code editors are free, they have some really amazing functions. But occasionally, professionals, who need even more specialist functions, buy programming products online. In this lesson we will make a receipt page that can be seen when buying stuff online.
